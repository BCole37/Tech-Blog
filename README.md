#Tech Blog

## Project Detials
make a tech blog that uses handlebars and java allowing a user to login in and see the tech blog as well as contribute.

# Why
To utilize handlebars and make a login for the fist time on our own as well as to deploy the app to heroku

# Problems
I am having a hard time with handlebars and this assignment I will hopefully be able to fix it and come back to it. As the backend logic i believe is complete based off the miniproject but the handlerbars has gone nowhere

# Sources For Help
Week 14 miniproject
